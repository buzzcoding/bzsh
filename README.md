# Buzz Shell (bzsh)
A minimal shell I am writing for portability and for more experience programming<br>
**Note: Please don't use this on production, especially because it is still in alpha.**

# Compiling
## Unix
### Requirements
* A C compiler
* A libc implementation

### Building
1. Downloading or git clone the source code
    * Git clone command: `git clone https://github.com/buzzcoding/bzsh`
2. Compile the source using the `./compile.sh` script
3. Install it somewhere (Ex: `su -c "install ./bzsh /usr/local/bin/"`, replace `su -c` with sudo or doas and remove the quotes if you have one of those packages installed)

## Windows
*Windows support and instructions coming soon*
