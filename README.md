# Buzz Shell (bzsh)
A minimal shell I am writing for portability and for more experience programming<br>
**Note: Please don't use this on production, especially because it is still in alpha.**

# Compiling
## Unix (Linux, Mac OS, BSD, System V, etc.)
### Requirements
* A C compiler
* A libc implementation

### Building
1. Download or *git clone* the source code
    * Git clone command: `git clone https://github.com/buzzcoding/bzsh`
2. Compile the source code using `bash compile.sh`
3. Install it somewhere (Ex: `install ./bzsh /usr/local/bin/` as root or using sudo, doas, or su -c "")

## Windows
*Windows support and instructions coming soon*
